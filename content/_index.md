Greetings, fellow humans and AI enthusiasts! You've just stumbled upon the virtual habitat of Srimanth Agastyaraju - where bits meet brains and pixels party with purpose! 🎉🧠

Caution: May cause sudden urges to containerize everything and dream in PyTorch 💤
Ready to dive into the AI ocean? Let's make waves together! 🌊🤖

As an AI Engineer and Deep Learning enthusiast, I'm teaching machines to see (without the need for glasses 👓) and think 🤔 (without the existential crises!). Current humor setting is at 75%.

<!-- I trained a deep learning model to write jokes, but its humor was too convolutional for most people 👀 -->

When I'm not fine-tuning models or debugging at light speed 💨, you'll find me:
+ Training GANs and Diffusion models to meme 🎭
+ Explaining backpropagation in reverse 🔄
+ Optimizing life with gradient descent 📈

**Warning: Reading my [blogs](/blog) may cause an irresistible urge to [hire me](mailto:srimanthagastyaraju.98@gmail.com). Side effects include increased team productivity, skyrocketing AI capabilities, and a much funnier workplace 💯. Jokes aside, you can [find me here.](/about)** 

If you're looking for an AI engineer who can make your neural networks laugh while they learn, you've come to the right place! Remember: In this blog, overfitting is just another word for being too awesome! I'm ready to overfit into your company culture! 😎
